# Python ECS Concept
This repository contains Entity Component System concept written on the Python language. Can be used for gamedev.
This ECS implementation very raw and primitive now, since I'm using this repo just to explore Python features and syntax, and needed some gameplay loop to work with games in Python.

# Dependencies
This project uses Raylib python bindings, so, in order to work, repo requires to install **raylibpy**.
